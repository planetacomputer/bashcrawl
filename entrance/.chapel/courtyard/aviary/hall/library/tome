View the world in color!

If you have a modern, color terminal, you can view the
output of the ls command in color!  This will still be a
valid command if you don't have a color terminal, you just
won't see colors.  Try this:

alias ls='ls -F --color=auto'

Now when you run the "ls" command by itself, rooms
(directories), scrolls (text files), and encounters
(executable files) should each have different colors.
Depending on the \$LS_COLORS variable, many other files will
have different colors too!  

You can read more about colors by consulting the 
"dircolors" manual.  To read more, type this spell:

man dircolors

In the manual, you can type 'q' (without quotes) to
exit the manual page.

Keep track of where you've been!

Instead of using "cd <room>" and "cd .." to 
navigate the catacombs, you can keep track of the
rooms you've been in by using "pushd" and "popd". 
"pushd", as the name implies, pushes the directory you
pass as the argument onto the room (directory) stack.
Use it like so:

pushd <room>

The angle brackets mean you specify the room (directory),
you don't type the angle brackets.  To see your current
stack, type the following command:

dirs

This will print out the list of directories on the stack. 
The data structure is a known as a stack, because you only
add or remove elements from the top of the stack, it is also
known as a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.  To
remove the top room (directory) from the stack, and change
directory to the new directory on the top of the stack, use 
"popd", like so:

popd

This will remove the top element of the stack ("pop" it off the
stack), and change directory to the next top of the stack.

Here's an example.  You're in a room (directory) called 
~/bashcrawl/entrance/field/, with the following
other rooms:

cemetary/ jail/ oubliette/

To change directory to the cemetary, and place it on the directory
stack, use this:

pushd cemetary

Now, the directory stack (output of the "dirs" command),
shows this:

~/bashcrawl/entrance/field/cemetary ~/bashcrawl/entrance/field

...and your current directory (present working directory,
held in the \$PWD variable) is the cemetary.  To go back to
the field, run "popd".  The directory stack will return to
~/bashcrawl/entrance/field, and your current directory will
be that directory.  You can mix and match "pushd" with "cd",
and only the directories you add with "pushd" will be on the
stack.  This is useful for returning to another directory,
after exploring the rest of the dungeon.

Good luck!

Map the entire dungeon!

You can see the layout of the entire dungeon using the
"tree" command.  You may need to install it as a separate
package, consult your operating system package manager for
details on how to do this.  If you're reading this from the
library, your relative current directory path should be:

entrance/chapel/courtyard/aviary/hall/library

If you run the following command, from the library:

tree -F ..

You should see this:

..
├── library/
│   ├── scroll
│   └── tome*
└── ${monster}*

The "tree" command takes many of the same options as the
"ls" command, including colors and viewing hidden files.  Go
back to the entrance and try it out!

Use emacs mode to navigate the command prompt (CLI)!

By default, in Bash, emacs mode is enabled.  If it is not
enabled you can run this in your shell:

set -o emacs

This allows you to move the cursor in the shell faster than
using the arrow keys alone.  Specific command key
chords/combinations can be used, like so:

- Ctrl-a:  move cursor to the beginning of the line
- Ctrl-e:  move cursor to the end of the line
- Meta-b:  (or Alt-b), move backward one word
- Meta-f:  (or Alt-f), move forward one word
- Ctrl-u:  Cut from cursor to beginning of line
- Ctrl-k:  Cut from cursor to end of line
- Ctrl-w:  Cut previous word
- Ctrl-y:  Paste what you just cut with Ctrl-u, Ctrl-k, or
           Ctrl-w
- Ctrl-_:  Undo last cut (may not work in all terminals)

Now you can navigate the shell like a pro!

Use the tmux terminal multiplexer!

tmux is a terminal multiplexer, which allows the user to
manage sessions, windows, and panes within the terminal.
The biggest reason to use a terminal multiplexer is that it
keeps the shells in each of its panes persistent, meaning
you can detach and reattach to tmux panes, windows, and
sessions (possibly from another computer altogether),
without losing your work, or where you were.  You can even
use tmux to share the terminal with another user (who is
using a different computer from the one you are using), just
have them connect to the same session!

tmux is a separate package, and may not be installed by
default.  Consult your operating system package manager
manual for details on installing tmux.

You can launch tmux using the following command:

tmux new-session -s <session_name>

Where <session_name> can be replaced by the arbitrary name
you want to give the session.  If you don't want to name the
session, you can leave off "-s <session_name>".  

By default, tmux will create the new session with one
window, and that window will have but one pane.  Each pane
created by tmux is a pseudo terminal, running its own
independent shell.  There will be a status bar at the bottom
of the tmux pane, with the session name (if any) and
numbered windows.

To interact with tmux inside of a tmux pane, you pass the
prefix key, which is Ctrl-b by default.  You can then hit
another key to have tmux do something useful.  One such
useful thing is to split the tmux pane vertically, with a
horizontal line separating your old pane and the freshly
launched new pane on the bottom.  To do this, type the
following:

Ctrl-b, then %

Instead of %, you can type " to split the pane horizontally,
with a vertical line separating the two panes.  You can type
:, to enter the tmux shell, and issue arbitrary tmux
commands that way.  See the tmux manual for details:

man tmux

To detach from the tmux session, you can issue the following
keystrokes:

Ctrl-b, then d

...for "Detach".  Then, later on, possibly from a different computer
altogether (connecting to the computer running tmux over SSH
or some other remote shell program), you can attach to the
tmux session with the following command:

tmux attach -t <session_name>

tmux has a complete configuration language, which is by
default stored in ~/.tmux.conf.  You can set up arbitrary
keystrokes in the configuration file, to make tmux behave
however you want.  The limit is your imagination!

Learn simple brace expansion and for loops!

Let's say you have several files, named like so:

file00
file01
file02
file03
...
file97
file98
file99

You can loop through them, and perform any operation on
them.  For instance, let's assume you want to compress each
file individually, without adding them to a single, large
tar (or ZIP) archive.   Instead of laboriously running the
commands 100 times for 100 files, you can use a for loop,
and operate on each file individually.  

One way to achieve this is through a simple brace expansion.
In Bash, insted of writing the following (which is very
labor intensive):

gzip file00 
gzip file01
gzip file02
gzip file03
...
gzip file97
gzip file98
gzip file99

You can achieve the same results by typing the following
brace expansion:

gzip file{00..99}

You can also put this into a for loop, like so:

for i in {00..99}; do
    gzip file\${i}
done

Yet another loop (that doesn't use a brace expansion) could
be:

for file in file*; do
    gzip \${file}
done

All of the above commands achieve the same result, each file
will be compressed with gzip individually.

cat << EOF

You see a large tome on the table, open
to a page in the middle of the book.

EOF

printf "Do you read it? y/n  "
read RESP

if [ "${RESP}" = "y" -o "${RESP}" = "Y" ]; then
    cat << EOF

The tome appears to be a book of spells.  Here is the 
first spell:

EOF

    while [ "${RESP}" = 'y' -o "${RESP}" = 'Y' ]; do
        random_page
    
        printf "Do you want to read another spell? y/n  "
        read RESP
    done
