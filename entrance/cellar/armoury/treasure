You have found a gleaming silver **sword**!  You marvel at
its craftsmanship, and you recall tales from your childhood
of the great mystic king Rannismir who bore such a sword to
protect the kingdom from undead.

Add this item to your inventory:

export I=sword,\$I

Remember, you can check your inventory:

echo \$I
